# Inspiration
This project was inspired by the **Next.js 15 Crash Course** by [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq5fmkH0T78&t=2s&ab_channel=JavaScriptMastery). The video provided a great foundation for building modern full-stack applications using Next.js 15, Sanity, and authentication with NextAuth.js.
